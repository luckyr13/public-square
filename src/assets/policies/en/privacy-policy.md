## 3. To which recipients will personal data be transmitted and where are they located?

In the course of our data processing, we transmit personal data to the following recipients to the extent necessary: service providers, legal representatives, courts and administrative authorities as well as companies that are commissioned to support our company's internal IT infrastructure (software, hardware).

We use processors who perform services on our behalf. The processors may only process the data provided to them in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary for us to carry out services.

The level of data protection in other countries outside the EEA may not be the same as within the EEA. We only transfer your personal data to countries for which the European Commission has decided that they have an adequate level of data protection or we take measures to ensure that all recipients in third countries guarantee an adequate level of data protection. To this end, we conclude, for example, the standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission with these recipients. 

## 4. Links to Social Media (Twitter, LinkedIn)

On our website you will find links to the social media services of Twitter and LinkedIn. You can recognize links to the websites of the social media services by the respective company logo. If you follow these links, you will reach the corporate presence of accelerateAR.co at the respective social media service. When you click on a link to a social media service, a connection to the servers of the social media service is established. This transmits the information that you have visited our website to the respective servers of the social media service. In addition, further data is transmitted to the provider of the social media service by your browser when you open the website of the social media service. These are, for example: the address of the website on which the activated link is located ("referrer"); date and time of calling up the website or activating the link; information about the browser and operating system used or the IP address.

If you are already logged in to the corresponding social media service at the time of clicking on the link, the provider of the social media service may be able to determine your user name and possibly even your real name from the transmitted data and assign this information to your personal user account with the social media service. You can prevent this if you log out of your user account beforehand.

The servers of the social media services are located in the US and other countries outside the European Union. The data may therefore also be processed by the provider of the social media service in countries outside the European Union. Please note that companies in these countries may be subject to data protection laws that do not generally protect personal data to the same extent as they do in the member states of the European Union. 

## 5. Profiling

We process personal data neither automatically nor non-automatically with the aim of evaluating certain personal aspects (profiling).

## 6. To what extent is there automated decision-making?

We do not use fully automated decision-making in accordance with Article 22 GDPR. If we use these processes in the future, we will inform separately about this and the rights in this regard, provided this is required by law.

## 7. Rights

Users have the right to information under Article 15 GDPR, the right to recti cation under Article 16 GDPR, the right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR, the right to object under Article 21 GDPR, the right not to be subject to automated decisions in individual cases, including pro ling, and the right to data portability in accordance with Article 20 GDPR. In addition, there is a right of appeal to a competent data protection supervisory authority (Article 77 GDPR).

The competent supervisory authority is the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG), or any applicable national supervisory authority according to the territorial jurisdiction of the customer.
