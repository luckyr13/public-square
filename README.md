# PublicSquare v2
A decentralized Social Media platform based on the PublicSquare protocol.

PublicSquare v2 is an Arweave dapp, a web3 website that lives on the permaweb. All our data is hosted on the Arweave blockchain. So yeah, it's kinda like a decentralized Twitter.

## Installation (for developers only)
PublicSquare v2 is made in Angular framework so you will need to have Node installed on your machine. For installing on your own environment just follow the next steps:

- Clone the project
- Run `npm install` from your command line
- And that's it!

## Development server (for developers only)

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build (for developers only)

Run `ng build` or `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
